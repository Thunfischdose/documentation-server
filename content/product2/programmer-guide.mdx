# Product 2 Programmer Guide

![CI Pipeline](https://via.placeholder.com/800x420?text=CI+Pipeline)

Product 2 focuses on automation. Use this guide to prepare your development workstation and deploy the processing service.

## Build Requirements

| Component | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.12 | Required for control-plane tooling |
| Node.js | 22 (Active) | Supports the real-time dashboard |
| PowerShell | 7.4 | Required for deployment scripts |

## Installing the Windows Service

```powershell
# Publish the .NET worker artifacts
msbuild .\workers\Product2.Agent.csproj /t:Publish /p:Configuration=Release

# Remove any stale instance before installing
sc.exe delete Product2Agent 2>$null | Out-Null
Start-Sleep -Seconds 3

# Register and configure recovery options
sc.exe create Product2Agent binPath= "C:\\ops\\Product2\\Product2.Agent.exe" start= delayed-auto
sc.exe failure Product2Agent reset= 86400 actions= restart/600

# Kick off the agent
sc.exe start Product2Agent
```

Validate the service by reviewing the Windows Event Log under **Applications and Services Logs > Product2**.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repo and run `npm install` inside `dashboard/` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside `control-plane/`.
2. Execute `npm run dev` to start the live dashboard and `python manage.py runserver` for the control plane API.
3. Commit new automation scripts under `automation/playbooks/` and add unit tests before opening a PR.
