## Weekly Maintenance

| Refresh geo-replication | Trigger the geo-sync job via the admin console. | Platform admin |
| Audit access policies | Export the current policy map and review changes. | Compliance |
| Archive stale tenants | Suspend workspaces inactive for 90+ days. | Billing ops |

## Incident Response

1. Enable maintenance mode to gracefully drain active sessions.
2. Snapshot the `product2-core` database for forensic analysis.
3. Escalate to L3 support if recovery exceeds 30 minutes.
