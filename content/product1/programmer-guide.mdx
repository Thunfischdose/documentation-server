# Product 1 Programmer Guide

![Developer Workflow](https://via.placeholder.com/800x420?text=Developer+Workflow)

Product 1 exposes a modular SDK to customize the pipeline. Review the following installation steps before extending the service.

## Environment Matrix

| Component | Recommended Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | 20 LTS | Required for build tooling |
| .NET SDK | 8.0 | Needed for background worker service |
| MSBuild | 17.x | Ship continuous integration builds |

## Installing the Windows Service

```powershell
# Build the worker project
msbuild .\workers\Product1.Service.csproj /t:Publish /p:Configuration=Release

# Register the service with sc.exe
sc.exe create Product1Worker binPath= "C:\\deploy\\Product1\\Product1.Service.exe" start= auto

# Start the newly created service
sc.exe start Product1Worker
```

After installation, validate the service is running by executing `Get-Service Product1Worker` and confirming the status `Running`.

## Extending the Pipeline

1. Duplicate `sdk/pipelines/sample-extension.ts` and rename it after your module.
2. Register the extension in `sdk/index.ts` under the `loadExtensions` call.
3. Ship an integration test using Jest to assert the new behavior.
